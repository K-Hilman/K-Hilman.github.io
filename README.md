# K-Hilman.github.io

This is where I park my items to allow for easier access to my projects.

The web codes are hosted on github directly and can be accessed through https://k-hilman.github.io/.

In this website, you'll find the lique app (android and web-application version).

You'll also find the archive of the works done in fulfillment of my degree during semester 3.

The flash files were used despite its obsolescence due to the requirement set by the course.

You can also visit my updated online CV or download my resume at https://k-hilman.com/ for better representation of my current skills.
